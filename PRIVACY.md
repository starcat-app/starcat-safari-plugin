# Privacy Policy

Starcat Safari Plugin is a local companion extension for Starcat. It enhances GitHub repository pages with context already available in the Starcat app.

## Data Collection

The extension does not collect, sell, or share personal data.

The extension does not:

- Track browsing history.
- Send page content to Starcat servers.
- Call GitHub APIs directly.
- Call OpenSSF, AI providers, or Starcat backend services directly.
- Use analytics, telemetry, or advertising SDKs.

## Local Data Storage

The extension stores only the minimum pairing configuration in browser local extension storage:

- Starcat local service port.
- Starcat Local API Key.

The Local API Key is used only to authenticate requests to the local Starcat app service on `127.0.0.1`.

## Local Communication

The extension communicates with:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:{port}/plugin/v1
```

The Starcat app owns all business data, including repository context, private notes, wiki links, recommendations, health scores, and CodeFlow / Codebase actions.

## Page Access

The extension reads the current GitHub page URL to identify the repository owner and name, and injects Starcat UI into GitHub repository pages.

It also runs on Google Search result pages to identify links to GitHub repositories. For up to eight visible GitHub repository results, it uses the repository owner and name to request local Starcat context and may display an `Open in Starcat` action and Health information. It does not store the full Google page or send it to Starcat servers.

## Private Notes

When you edit a note from GitHub, the extension sends the note content to the local Starcat app. The extension does not persist note content in Safari extension storage.

## Changes

Privacy-related changes should be documented in this file before release.
